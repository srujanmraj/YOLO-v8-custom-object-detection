# YOLO-v8-custom-object-detection
YOLOv8 is the newest state-of-the-art YOLO model that can be used for object detection, image classification, and instance segmentation tasks.
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a custom object detection system using YOLO-v8 and train it to detect and classify specific objects in images and videos. The project includes the following components:

- **Data**: Describes the dataset used for training and evaluation. Include information on the data sources, annotation format, and any preprocessing steps performed.

- **Model Architecture**: Provides an overview of the YOLO-v8 model architecture, highlighting the key components and explaining the network structure.

- **Training**: Details the steps taken to train the YOLO-v8 model. This includes information on hyperparameter tuning, training duration, and any techniques employed to improve model performance.

- **Evaluation**: Describes the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).

- **Inference**: Explains how to use the trained model for object detection on new images and videos. Include instructions on setting up the environment, running the inference script, and visualizing the results.

- **Results**: Showcases the results achieved by the model, including sample images or videos with bounding boxes and class labels overlaid.

- **Dependencies**: Lists the required dependencies and their versions. Include instructions for installing the dependencies using package managers like pip or conda.
